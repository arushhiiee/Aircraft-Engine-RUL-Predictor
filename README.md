# Predictive Maintenance: Aircraft Engine RUL Predictor

This project implements an advanced deep learning model to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft turbofan engines based on the NASA C-MAPSS dataset. The system includes an interactive web GUI built with Flask for real-time predictions and model explainability using SHAP.

## Features

-   **Advanced Modeling:** Uses a hybrid CNN-GRU architecture to capture both spatial and temporal features from sensor data.
-   **Full Data Pipeline:** Includes scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training for all four C-MAPSS datasets.
-   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrates the SHAP library to provide visual explanations for each prediction, moving beyond a "black box" model.
-   **Interactive GUI:** A user-friendly web interface built with Flask and Tailwind CSS allows for real-time RUL prediction by inputting sensor values.

## Demo

Here is a demonstration of the interactive web application.

**1. Input Sensor Data:** The user selects a dataset and inputs the latest sensor readings for an engine.

**2. Prediction and Explanation:** The application returns the predicted RUL and a SHAP waterfall plot that explains which features had the most impact on the prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Aircraft-Engine-RUL-Predictor.git](https://github.com/your-username/Aircraft-Engine-RUL-Predictor.git)
    cd Aircraft-Engine-RUL-Predictor
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file. See below.)*

3.  **Download the Dataset:**
    Download the C-MAPSS dataset from the [NASA Prognostics Data Repository](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/) and place all the `.txt` files (e.g., `train_FD001.txt`) in the root directory of this project.

### How to Run

1.  **Prepare and Train the Models:**
    Run the preparation script. This will train a model for each of the four datasets and save the necessary artifacts (models, scalers, feature lists) into a `models/` directory. This step will take several minutes.
    ```bash
    python prepare_models.py
    ```

2.  **Launch the Interactive GUI:**
    Once the models are prepared, start the Flask web application.
    ```bash
    flask --app app run
    ```
    Open your web browser and navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:5000**.
